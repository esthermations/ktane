Like Keypad, we don't implement Simon Says, because adding a bot to the
process only makes it more difficult.

Assuming you have no strikes, the bomb-defuser can memorise how to play Simon
Says and finish the module without even telling the manual-reader.

The rule goes like this:

Does the serial number contain a vowel?
If yes, swap red/blue and green/yellow in your replies.

If no, do this:
1. Pretend green is a totally separate button. Reply to green with green.
2. Rotate your other responses clockwise once, ignoring green.

That might be hard to understand from a short explanation, but compare those
rules to the no-strikes entries in the manual and it should be pretty clear.

This is simple enough that you don't even need a manual-reader to help you
solve it, so I don't see a bot being too helpful here.
