For this one we need to define names for the symbols. Unfortunately it's not
as easy as using the first character, like in other solvers.

I suppose every group of players ends up with their own names for these
things. Mine are in here.

In the manual, read each column top-to-bottom.

Column 1: head, pyramid, lambda, heartbeat, spaceship, h, backwards-c
Column 2: euro, head, backwards-c, ribbon, empty-star, h, question-mark
Column 3: copyright, w, ribbon, x, broken-3, lambda, empty-star
Column 4: flat-6, paragraph, b, spaceship, x, question-mark, smiley
Column 5: trident, smiley, b, c, paragraph, evil-3, full-star
Column 6: flat-6 , euro, not-equal, ae, trident, n, omega

To be honest, I'm not convinced writing a program to do this would save any
time. Probably only a second or two, at most.

Because of that, I'll move on and write other things first.
