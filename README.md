  This is a small program for the Linux command-line that helps you cheat at
  *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*.

  The premise is that this program takes the place of the manual for most
  puzzles.

## Modules this can solve

  It currently solves these modules:

  1. Simple Wires
  2. Buttons
  3. Who's On First
  4. Morse Code
  5. Complicated Wires
  6. Wire Sequence
  7. Password

  This may or may not ever solve Simon Says or Keypad. The reasoning behind
  that can be found in the [simon_says.txt](./solvers/simon_says.txt) and [keypad.txt](./solvers/keypad.txt) files.
